            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thereafter, not onely were Propoſitions of Peace (which after ſerious and mature Deliberation were agreed upon) tendered to Him in the Name of both Kingdoms for His Royal Aſſent thereunto; but alſo the chief Judicatories of this Kingdom, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, made their humble and

They doe anſwer their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that nothing needs to be ſaid unto them, for removing any jealouſies out of their hearts, or for ſtrengthning that confidence which they have in the affections of that Nation: And they doe preſume that the Proceedings of the Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> from the very beginning of theſe troubles, are a ſufficient declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their integrity, and of their conſtant affection to their Brethren of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And as to the deſires of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> they doe returne theſe Anſwers.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, That when the King ſhall be at <hi>Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and the Scottiſh Forces gone out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, both Houſes of Parliament (ſaving according to their former Declarations the peculiar Rights of the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>) will then appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151694:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>of theirs, to joyne with a Committee of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to imploy their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to procure his Majeſties aſſent to the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agreed on by both Kingdomes, and preſented to His Majeſtie at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and to the diſpoſing of the Biſhops Lands, according to the Ordinances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed both Houſes in that behalfe. And in caſe the King ſhall not give his aſſent thereunto, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Houſes are ſtill reſolved, firmly to continue and maintaine, the happy Union between the two Kingdomes, according to the Treaties and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; And that according to the late Treaty between the Kingdomes, no Ceſſation, nor any Pacification, or agreement for Peace whatſoever, ſhall be made by either Kingdome, or the Armies of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without the mutuall advice and conſent of both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond deſire, both Houſes doe declare, that it is not their intention, by their appointing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to waite upon the King in his journie to <hi>Holmby,</hi> to make a ſettlement of any Perſons in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, nor to be any prejudice to any of the Kings Servants that are of either Nation, who have adhered to the Parliaments: And that none ſhall be debarred from having acceſſe to his Majeſtie, who have warrant from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or from the Committee of that Parliament thereunto authoriſed, except ſuch as are diſabled by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions agreed on by both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>To the third deſire, the comming of the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151694:8"/>to the Votes of both Houſes of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> being agreeable to the Covenant and Treaties; They do declare, that upon any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that ſhall ariſe to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the ſame, they will aſſiſt them according to the ſaid Covenant and Treaties.</p>
            <p>To the fourth and laſt deſire, both Houſes returne Anſwer, That their Garriſons being delivered up, and the Scottiſh Army and Forces being marched out of this Kingdome, they will take this their deſire into ſpeedy conſideration. This being all we have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Houſes, we reſt,</p>
